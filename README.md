# Learning DevOps Manually
This code is me following along with the Udemy course by **Imran Teli** named [DevOps Projects | 20 Real Time DevOps Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/devopsprojects/) except that my lab is using VMWare Workstation Pro.

The first part of the project is learning how to setup the environment manully and then move into automating the steps since you now understand what needs to happen.

# Prerequisites if using Vagrant with VMWare Workstation Pro
- You will need to install the Vagrant VMware provider [link](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/vmware/installation)
- You will need to install the Vagrant VMWare Utility [link](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/vmware/vagrant-vmware-utility)

# Setup
## Install Vagrant
- Follow the steps [Here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vagrant/getting-started-install?in=vagrant/getting-started) or follow the course to get started

# Configure Vagrant config
- You will need to change your config file to reference VMware at the start of the config
  ```vagrant
  Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vm.provider "vmware_desktop" do |v|
        v.gui = true
    end
    config.hostmanager.enabled = true 
    config.hostmanager.manage_host = true
  ```

# Notes
- Not all Vagrant boxes work with your provider. You can use the Vagrant Marketplace to find boxes that are compatible. [Here](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?provider=vmware)
